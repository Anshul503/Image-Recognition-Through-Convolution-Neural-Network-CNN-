# Image-Recognition-Through-Convolution-Neural-Network-CNN-
In this, we will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else.   For example, we will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if we want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then we will literally be able to take a picture of our cat or our dog, and our model will predict which pet you have.
